    <p> I am a senior lecturer (assistant professor) at the Tel Aviv University School of Economics. I also serve as a Research Fellow at CEPR Political Economy. Before joining Tel Aviv University, I visited MIT as a post-doc and received my PhD from Yale University. </p>

    <p>  My research focuses on political economy and social media. I am especially interested in studying the forces shaping social norms, political attitudes, and policy preferences, and their subsequent influence on individual behavior. My research has appeared in top journals such as the American Economic Reivew, and has been cited by major policy reports, such as  the U.S. Surgeon Generalâ€™s Advisory on Social Media and Economic Reports of the President (2023, 2024).</p>
