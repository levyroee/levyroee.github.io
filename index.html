    <p> I am a Senior Lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the Tel Aviv University School of Economics and a Research Fellow at CEPR Political Economy. Before joining Tel Aviv University, I visited MIT as a post-doc and received my PhD from Yale University. </p>

    <p>  My research focuses on political economy and social media. My work has been published in leading journals such as the <i>American Economic Review</i> and cited by major policy reports, including the U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory on Social Media and the <i>Economic Reports of the President</i> (2023, 2024).</p>
	
	<p>  My ERC Starting Grant, ECHO, studies the supply and demand of news slant. You can find my research statement <a href="cv/2025-11_Levy_-_Research_statement.pdf"> here</a>.
