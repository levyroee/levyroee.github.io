abstract: Coverage of the Gaza War varies enormously across the two sides of the conflict, and both sides hold sharply different beliefs about the facts of the conflict. We conduct a survey experiment in Israel and Jordan asking whether individuals avoid news about civilian victims from the opposing side, and how such news would affect them if they were exposed to it. We present several key findings. First, Israeli Jews and Jordanian Arabs are substantially less willing to read about outgroup victims than ingroup victims. Second, news avoidance is driven less by instrumental considerations or universal affective factors, and more by social identity and group norms. Third, reading about outgroup victims increases knowledge, fosters empathy toward the outgroup, and affects policy positions. Fourth, these effects also arise among individuals who would rather avoid such news. Together, our results suggest that avoidance of news about outgroup victims contributes to disagreements about facts and inter-group animosity, and may exacerbate conflict.
